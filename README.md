This project is a simple and practical blog built using the powerful Django framework and MySQL database. The goal of this project is to provide a platform for users to create, view, and manage posts. In addition, other features such as user registration and login, profile management, advanced post search, a comment system, and an API for all the mentioned features have also been implemented in this project.

Key Features:

Comprehensive Post Management: Users can create new posts, edit or delete their existing posts, and view the list of posts in a categorized and organized manner. The ability to save and like posts is also provided.
User Management System: Users can easily register on the site, log in to their accounts, and manage their profiles. Password recovery is also considered.
Advanced Search: Users can search for posts based on title, content, and even author. This feature enables fast and accurate searches for desired content.
Comment System: Users can post comments under posts and discuss shared content with others.
Functional API: This project has a powerful API for various operations such as registration, login, post creation, comment management, liking and saving posts, etc. This API allows developers to use the blog's features in other applications.
Role Management: The ability to define different roles for users (such as administrator and regular user) exists. The site administrator can manage users and grant them various access levels.
Post Approval: To prevent the publication of inappropriate content, posts submitted by users must be approved by the site administrator before publication.
Attractive and Responsive User Interface: The blog's user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a pleasant user experience.
Implementation of Views in Two Ways: The views of this project are rendered both in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and are accessible as HTTP responses. This provides high flexibility for developers.
JSON Endpoints: All project views are implemented as JSON endpoints and return data in JSON format. This enables easy communication between other applications and the project's API.
